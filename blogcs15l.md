* Then click on the blue link below saying "Global Password Change Tool" to change the password of your cse15l username displayed as: cs15lsp23__

* If facing any issues with resetting the password, this tutorial link will be helpful: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hs7CyQeh-MdUfM9uv99i8tqfneos6Y8bDU0uhn1wqho/edit
* Once the password is succesfully changed, you're ready to go to follow the other steps down below

## Part 2- Setup Visual Studio Code
* For this step, you will need a personal laptop or the school computer in order to progress with the installation of VScode. If using a school computer, installation can be skipped as all school computers already have VScode and bash installed. 
* To download VScode, head to https://code.visualstudio.com/ and chronologicall seek instructions in order to successfully download VScode on your device, choosing the preferred version for your macOS or Windows, respectively.
* Upon opening the application, you will see a window that seems similar to this (it might be the dark version or the same as this!)

* It is appreciated if students can take a screenshot after reaching this checkpoint to ensure their progress to their Professor!

## Part 3- Connecting remotely
* The first step is to install git on your device. For windows: https://gitforwindows.org/
* To use git bash in VScode follow these steps https://stackoverflow.com/a/50527994
* After that, open a new terminal in the VScode accessing the Terminal menu. In the screenshot below, my command is being displayed, with your command the letters 'nj' should change.

* Your terminal might give more or less commands than my terminal's output. Finally, now your terminal is connected to CSE basement computer and can run commands on that computer. 

* It is very easy to get stuck somewhere in a tutorial, so please take screenshots of wherever you get stuck! Some feedback might be helpful for the next tutorial!
